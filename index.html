			Hello! Thanks for visiting my page, let me introduce myself.
			My name is Max and I’m a junior at the University of Pennsylvania.
			Currently, I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and History
			in the College of Arts and Sciences.
	<br><br>
		Born and raised in rural Ohio, I’ve made the transition from
		sprawling country roads to the dense urban jungle of Philadelphia.
		The last two years have been an amazing journey, full of intellectual, professional,
		and personal development. Now, at the midpoint of my college career, I am inching
		toward graduation and the next chapter of my life.
		My career interests include Technological Consulting, Web/Software
		Development, and management within the Tech Sector. In the years to come,
		I hope to become established in the technology industry, either at a major
		firm or a fresh startup.
	<br><br>
		My personal activities include fitness and sports, reading and writing,
		 and music. I’m a massive soccer fan, and play at least once a week. Even
		 with the hectic schedules of college, I try to make time for personal
		  reading, as well as keeping a nightly journal. I've started DJing, which has become an
			exciting creative outlet.
